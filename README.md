# Makefile-generator

This project is a small web app that makes it possible to create nice looking Makefiles in seconds. This project is mainly for the 42 foundation and is still a work in progress.

## Running the project independently

If you want to run the project yourself on localhost you can do it by:

```bash
# In the project directory
npm install

# Run the dev server
npm run dev
```

## Online version

There will also be a online version available on my website.
